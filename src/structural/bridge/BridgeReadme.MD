# Difference between Bridge Pattern and Other Patterns
* **Adapter Pattern** - This design pattern is commonly used with an existing app to allow objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate, whereas the Bridge Pattern is implemented up-front as a precautionary measure to allow us to develop various parts of an application independently of each other.
---
* **Strategy Pattern** - The Strategy design pattern is also used in scenarios where we have a set of closely related classes and uses object composition similar to that of Bridge Pattern, but Strategy Pattern is a behavioral pattern and allows algorithms to be interchanged while using the Strategy Pattern.
---
* **Abstract Factory** - It is a Creational Design Pattern that can be used along with the Bridge Design Patterns in cases where some of the abstractions defined by Bridge can only work with some specific implementations. In such cases, the Abstract Factory Pattern can encapsulate these relations and hide this information from the clients.
